Notes for the small motor controllers

Basic code to make them run:

int IN1 = 9; // <- labeled on the controller
int IN2 = 10; // <- labeled on the controller

void setup() {
  pinMode(IN1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(IN2, OUTPUT);

  digitalWrite(IN1, HIGH); // <- controls the direction of rotation
}

void loop() {
  analogWrite(IN2, 205);
  /* 
   * 2nd argument should be between 0-255
   * It controls speed
   * If IN1 is HIGH, then 255 is stop and 0 is max speed
   * If IN1 is LOW, then 0 is stop and 255 is max speed
   * 
   */
}
